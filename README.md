## 🗂️ Workflow Overview

The workflow follows the steps below to guide the user through an interactive experience:

1. **Telegram Trigger**  
   The bot listens for any incoming message from a user and starts the workflow.

2. **Greeting Detection (If Node)**  
   The system checks whether the user has sent a greeting (hi/hello/hey).  
   If not, the workflow ends.

3. **Ask for Subject (Interactive Form)**  
   The user is prompted to select a subject from a dropdown menu.

4. **Collect User Doubt (Free Text Input)**  
   Once a subject is selected, the bot asks:  
   _"What is your doubt in <subject>?"_

5. **AI Processing (LangChain Agent + Gemini)**  
   The AI model receives:
   - The selected subject  
   - The user’s doubt  
   - The system prompt with tone and rules  

   It generates a clear and student-friendly response.

6. **Response Delivery (Telegram Text Message)**  
   The final answer is sent back to the user directly in Telegram.

7. **Conversation Memory**  
   The system stores short-term history to support natural conversation.
